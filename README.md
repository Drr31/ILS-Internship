Overview
This repository contains the complete work done during my internship on extending and scaling coverage metrics for Neural Network testing, based on the CoVerNet methodology. The project focuses on improving the testing and verification processes of an NN

Structure
The repo is organized by weekly progress, with dedicated notebooks and scripts that document the theory, experiments, and results:

Week 1: Foundations and theoretical preparation, including a deep dive into neural networks and refreshing essential math concepts.

Week 2: Exploration and application of Python testing frameworks (unittest, pytest, doctest) to verify components of the pipeline.

Week 3: Clustering techniques and their application on datasets (e.g., Iris) for equivalence class formation.

Week 4: Implementation and timing analysis of Prior-Equivalence Classes (PEC) generation as part of the CoVerNet approach.
